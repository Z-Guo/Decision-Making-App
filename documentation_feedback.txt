DOCUMENTATION FEEDBACK:

You cover the basics of your project here, but I felt that this could be improved upon slightly. 
For example, detailing more information about your project - i.e a python based system with xyz front-end. 
Good separation of core and bonus features. You should make your sample architecture larger so that itâ€™s easier to read 
- if you include this document in your final project, please also check for certain spelling and grammar. 
Architecture diagram is simple but effective. You could be more specific here about the distribution of workload - 
define who will actually be doing what. Also, you could include how you will follow an agile workflow. 
Well thought through exploration of testing, possibly the most detailed section of the documentation. 
Overall, this document meets the requirements but could be more detailed in order to really champion your project 
and give you a clear road map. 

Score: 90/100
